 Al-Kashi is an educational project for math teachers who are willing to create math animations for their curriculums.

 We will be introducing easy-to-follow [manim](https://3b1b.github.io/manim) tutorials.
 
 The project was named after: [Jamshīd al-Kāshī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamsh%C4%ABd_al-K%C4%81sh%C4%AB) the famous Persian mathematician.
